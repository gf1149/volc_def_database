Description: 400km of the Rift was sampled during 3 different time periods (1997-2000, 2003-2006, 2006,2008). Envisat has acquired two to three per year since 2003.

Description: >>
The deformation is episodic. An episode of surface deformation was only obseverd from 1997-2000. Surface deformation was subsidence of 4.6cm. Best fitting source model for each episode of subsidence of inflation or deflation of a penny-sized crack at a depth 2-5Km. Observed transient uplift and subsidence of a second, nearby source is likely associated with the the complex plumbing system under the observed volcanos. The penny-sized crack is at 1.9Km and at a radius of 3.7Km. The deformation could also be explained by a Mogi source (point source).
